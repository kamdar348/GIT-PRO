        <p class="lp">Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: トヨタ自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Toyota
          Jidōsha KK, IPA: [toꜜjota], English: /tɔɪˈoʊtə/) is a Japanese
          multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota, Aichi,
          Japan. In 2017, Toyota's corporate structure consisted of 364,445
          employees worldwide[4] and, as of December 2019, was the tenth-largest
          company in the world by revenue. Toyota is the largest automobile
          manufacturer in Japan, and the second-largest in the world behind
          Volkswagen, based on 2018 unit sales.[5] Toyota was the world's
          first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million
          vehicles per year, which it has done since 2012, when it also
          reported the production of its 200-millionth vehicle.[6] As of July
          2014, Toyota was the largest listed company in Japan by market
          capitalization (worth more than twice as much as number 2-ranked
          SoftBank)[7] and by revenue.[8][9]</p>


        <p class="lp">Toyota is the global market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, and one of the largest
          companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe. Toyota is also a market
          leader in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Cumulative global sales of Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models
          achieved the 15 million milestone in January 2020.[10] Its Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid
          nameplate with over 6 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.[11]</p>

        <p class="lp">The company was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda in 1937, as a spinoff from his father's company Toyota
          Industries, to create automobiles. Three years earlier, in 1934, while still a department of Toyota
          Industries, it created its first product, the Type A engine, and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota
          AA. Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under five brands, including the Toyota brand, Hino, Lexus,
          Ranz, and Daihatsu. It also holds a 16.66% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.9% stake in Isuzu until 2018, a
          5.5% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, as well as joint-ventures with two in China (GAC Toyota and
          Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor), one in India (Toyota Kirloskar), one in the Czech Republic (TPCA), along with
          several "nonautomotive" companies.[12] TMC is part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in
          Japan.</p>

        <p class="lp">Toyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange

        <p class="lp">Toyota is headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi.[13] The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a
          four-story building in Toyota. As of 2006, the head office has the "Toyopet" Toyota logo and the words "Toyota
          Motor". The Toyota Technical Center, a 14-story building, and the Honsha plant, Toyota's second plant engaging
          in mass production and formerly named the Koromo plant, are adjacent to one another in a location near the
          headquarters. Vinod Jacob from The Hindu described the main headquarters building as "modest".[14] In 2013,
          company head Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due
          to the lack of amenities in the city.[15]</p>
        <p class="lp">Its Tokyo office is located in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Its Nagoya office is located in Nakamura-ku,
          Nagoya.[13] In addition to manufacturing automobiles, Toyota provides financial services through its Toyota
          Financial Services division, and also builds robots.</p>

          <p class="lp">In 1981, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. announced plans to merge with its sales entity Toyota Motor
            Sales Co., Ltd. Since 1950, the two entities had existed as separate companies as a prerequisite for
            reconstruction in postwar Japan. Shoichiro Toyoda presided over Toyota Motor Sales in preparation for the
            consummation of the merger that occurred in 1982. Shoichiro then succeeded his uncle Eiji as the president
            of the combined organization that then became known as Toyota Motor Corporation.</p>
